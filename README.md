# Barcelona vs Valladolid 2020: Pass Network Visualization

This project generates a pass network for Barcelona's match against Valladolid in 2020. It processes match data to visualize player connections and successful passes, showing how the team interacted on the field.

### Overview:
- Visualizes successful passes made by Barcelona before the first substitution.
- Node sizes now represent player influence, with larger nodes indicating higher involvement in passes (either as the passer or the recipient).
- Nodes represent players, and arrows represent passes between them.

### Example Visualization:

### Features:
- **Player Influence**: Nodes are sized proportionally to the number of passes a player was involved in, helping highlight key players in the team's passing network.
- **Pass Network**: Displays connections between players based on passes exchanged during the match.
- **Substitution Cutoff**: The visualization only includes passes made before Barcelonaâ€™s first substitution to focus on the pre-substitution phase of play.
